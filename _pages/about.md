I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I received my M.S. from KAIST, advised by Prof. Woo Chang Kim, and have continued my research in the Financial Engineering Lab. My research interests center on *Financial Engineering*, *Stochastic Optimization*, and *Decision-making under Uncertainty*.
